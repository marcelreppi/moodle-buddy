            Normally, a student would have to search a Moodle course for all
            downloadable resources and download them all one by one. This takes
            a lot of time and is a very annoying, redundant and mundane task.
            Sometimes students are also unaware of new material that has been
            uploaded to the course.
          </p>
          <p>
            This browser plugin saves students a lot of time as they can now see
            updates for all their courses and download all resources with the
            ease of just one click.

            I was a Masters Information Systems Management student at the

            The downloaded files are
            <i>.php</i>
            files and I can't open them. What is going on?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This usually occurs when a resource is pointing to a website. Please
          make sure that you can open the resource manually and it doesn't
          redirect you to another website. If this issue still occurs, please
          don't hesitate to contact me using
          <span class="link contact-link">this form</span>
          :)

        <p>
          <b>
            Where are my files stored?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Files will always be downloaded to the default download directory of
          your browser. Depending on the
          <span class="link options-link">download settings</span>
          , the files will either be inside a folder with the same name as the
          course name (default), a special "Moodle" folder or directly in the
          download directory.
        </p>

            Can I limit the maximum amount of concurrent downloads?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes! You can configure this in the
          <span class="link options-link">settings!</span>

        <p>
          Please clear the stored course data in the
          <span class="link options-link">settings.</span>
          This should hopefully fix it. If this issue still occurs, please don't

          You can either customize your Moodle dashboard to limit how many
          courses are display or you can configure the maximum amount of scanned
          course for the dashboard page in the
